# UnifiedDep: Unified Chinese Dependency Discourse Datasets

This repository contains the unified Chinese discourse dependency dataset described in the paper [Unifying Discourse Resources with Dependency Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00167.pdf). The dataset is now composed of **SciCDTB** developed by Peking University and **SU-CDTB_{dep}** converted from CDTB developed by Soochow University.

We have been authorized by Soochow University to release SU-CDTB_{dep}. If you use this dataset, please also cite the original CDTB paper [Building chinese discourse corpus with connective-driven dependency tree structure](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1224.pdf).

If you hope to get our converted HIT-CDTB_{dep} discourse dependency corpus, please first get the authorization of [HIT-CDTB](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/hit-cdtb/Project%20Introduction.html#download).
